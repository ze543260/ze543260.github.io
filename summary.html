            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>Buck is a pampered dog who lives in California. He is kidnapped by a group of thieves and sold to a team of sled dogs in the Yukon Territory. Buck quickly learns to survive in the harsh conditions of the Northland. He becomes a leader of the sled team and earns the respect of his fellow dogs.

                Buck is eventually sold to Hal, a cruel man who abuses him and his team. Buck escapes from Hal and joins a pack of wolves. He lives with the wolves for a time, but he eventually returns to Thornton, who has come to the Yukon in search of him.
